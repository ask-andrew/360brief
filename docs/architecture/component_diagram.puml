' Define interfaces
interface "REST API" as rest_api
interface "WebSocket" as ws
interface "OAuth 2.0" as oauth

' Frontend connections
dashboard --> rest_api
auth_ui --> oauth
settings --> rest_api
digest_viewer --> rest_api
connections --> rest_api

' Backend connections
api_gateway --> auth_service
api_gateway --> digest_service
api_gateway --> data_processing

digest_service --> data_processing
data_processing --> cache_service

' Data connections
auth_service --> user_store
digest_service --> digest_store
cache_service --> cache_store

' External connections
data_processing --> gmail

' Add notes
note right of data_processing
  == Data Processing ==
  • Handles data transformation
  • Implements business logic
  • Manages rate limiting
end note

note right of digest_service
  == Digest Generation ==
  • Creates executive summaries
  • Applies user preferences
  • Handles scheduling
end note
